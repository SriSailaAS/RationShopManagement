# RationShopManagement
The Ration Shop Management application is developed for managing the daily availability of the stocks and providing it for the customers in an economically efficient process. So the main objective of our application is to keep track of the available stocks from the start of the day which includes the processes like deduction of the count of the sold-out stocks and reporting the left out stocks the next day.This application also consists of authenticating the customer(providing the customer's identity) based on the card number.The customer should be able to view their monthly purchase and also the billing details.
